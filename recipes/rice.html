        <p>Steamed rice is one of the hardest things to cook for us westerners. Here is a simple way to do it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of rice</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 beef flavored cube</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the salt and the beef flavored cube into the water and boil it.</li>
            <li>Put the rice into the water and decrease heat to 4 or 5/8.</li>
            <li>Wait in front of the stove because from one minute to the next it might be overcooked.</li>
            <li>Take a grain of rice on your thumb and crush it between your fingers. When only a tiny part in the middle is still hard, 
                put your pan out of the stove and cover it.
            </li>
            <li>Let your rice cook. Wait 10 minutes or let it for longer.</li>
            <li>When you lift the lid, delicately mix the rice. It should ready to go.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
