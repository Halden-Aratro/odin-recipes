        <h2 id="description">What is it?</h2>
        <p>This is a simple guide for how to cook an omelette. <em>Be mindful of the small details</em> of appearance as they are crucial
            to your success.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>basilic leaves</li>
            <li>1 spoon of oil</li>
            <li>2 spoons of milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Break your eggs and put them into a bowl</li>
            <li>Add the milk</li>
            <li>With a fork, mix everything until you get small bubbles on the surface of your preparation.
                The color should be that of a light yellow (lighter than the original color of the eggs' yellow)
            </li>
            <li>Heat up a pan (heat 4 on 8) with the oil in it</li>
            <li>Add the pepper and chopped basilic to your preparation</li>
            <li>Pour the preparation into the pan and stay in front of it. When the omelette is hard but there is still some liquid on top of it,
                take the pan off the stove and serve. The warmth of the omelette will naturally cook the rest of the liquid still present.
            </li>
        </ol>
